# IntelliFlow

A sophisticated multi-agent data analysis and insights platform built using the Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Google Cloud services.

## Overview

IntelliFlow orchestrates seven specialized AI agents that collaborate autonomously to extract, process, analyze, and visualize data from diverse sources, transforming raw information into actionable business intelligence with minimal human intervention.

## Architecture

The system consists of the following specialized agents:

- **Data Scout Agent**: Discovers and extracts data from various sources
- **Data Engineer Agent**: Transforms raw data into analysis-ready formats
- **Analysis Strategist Agent**: Determines optimal analytical approaches
- **Insight Generator Agent**: Applies techniques to discover patterns and trends
- **Visualization Specialist Agent**: Creates visual representations of findings
- **Narrative Composer Agent**: Translates findings into business narratives
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Coordinates the entire agent ecosystem

## Technologies

IntelliFlow leverages the following technologies:

### Core Technologies
- Agent Development Kit (ADK): The foundation for creating and orchestrating all specialized agents
- Google Cloud Platform: Provides the infrastructure and services that enhance agent capabilities

### Google Cloud Services
- BigQuery: Powers large-scale data storage and SQL-based analysis
- Vertex AI: Enables machine learning model training and deployment
- Cloud Storage: Facilitates data staging and result persistence
- Pub/Sub: Handles inter-agent communication
- Cloud Functions: Supports serverless agent deployment
- Data Studio: Enhances visualization capabilities
- Document AI: Extracts structured data from unstructured documents
- Cloud Run: Hosts containerized agent services
- Cloud Firestore: Maintains shared context between agents
- Cloud Workflows: Manages complex multi-agent workflows
