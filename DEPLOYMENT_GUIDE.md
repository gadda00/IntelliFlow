# IntelliFlow Enhanced - Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Enhanced Features Implemented

### ✅ Fixed Issues:
1. **Unclickable Next Button**: Fixed file upload component to properly read file contents
2. **Real Data Processing**: System now processes actual uploaded data instead of example data
3. **Enhanced Multi-Agent System**: Backend agents now handle real CSV/JSON data analysis
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Performs actual t-tests and descriptive statistics on uploaded data

### 🔧 Technical Improvements:
- **File Upload Component**: Enhanced to read file contents and enable proper navigation
- **Backend Integration**: Flask service with multi-agent system for real data processing
- **API Integration**: Smart fallback between enhanced backend and mock API
- **Agent Enhancement**: Advanced Statistical Analysis agent processes real data
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback mechanisms for robust operation

## 🌐 Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Using Vercel CLI:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/ubuntu/IntelliFlow/frontend/intelliflow-ui
   npx vercel --token cjpFASgMGWwDtCiJ754wyMwR
   ```

2. **Using Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Upload the `dist/` folder contents to your Vercel project
   - Or connect your GitHub repository and deploy from main branch

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

1. **Build Files Location:**
   - Built files are in: `/home/ubuntu/IntelliFlow/frontend/intelliflow-ui/dist/`
   - Upload these files to your hosting provider

2. **Backend Service:**
   - The enhanced backend service is in: `/home/ubuntu/IntelliFlow/backend_service.py`
   - Deploy this to a Python hosting service (Heroku, Railway, etc.)

## 🔧 Configuration Notes

### Frontend Configuration:
- **API Endpoints**: Configured to use localhost:5000 for development
- **Fallback System**: Gracefully falls back to mock API if backend unavailable
- **File Processing**: Enhanced to handle CSV, TXT, and JSON files
- **Google ADK Integration**: Maximized usage as requested

### Backend Configuration:
- **Multi-Agent System**: 7 specialized agents for comprehensive analysis
- **Real Data Processing**: Handles actual uploaded files
- **Statistical Analysis**: Performs real t-tests, descriptive statistics
- **CORS Enabled**: Supports cross-origin requests from frontend
