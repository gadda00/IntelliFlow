## Installation

ADK can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install adk
```

For development installations, you can clone the repository and install in development mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agent-development-kit/adk.git
cd adk
pip install -e .
```

## Core Concepts

ADK is built around several key concepts:

### Agents

Agents are autonomous entities that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions. In ADK, agents are implemented as Python classes that inherit from the `Agent` base class.

### Messages

Agents communicate with each other by exchanging messages. Messages can contain any type of data, including text, structured data, or binary content.

### Tools

Tools are functions that agents can use to interact with their environment or perform specific tasks. ADK provides a rich set of built-in tools and allows you to create custom tools.

### Memory

Agents can store and retrieve information using different types of memory systems, including short-term, long-term, and working memory.

### Planning

ADK includes planning capabilities that allow agents to create and execute plans to achieve their goals.

## Creating Your First Agent

Here's a simple example of creating an agent with ADK:

```python
from adk import Agent, Message, tool

class MyAgent(Agent):
    def __init__(self, agent_id):
        super().__init__(agent_id)
        self.register_message_handler("greeting", self.handle_greeting)
    
    def handle_greeting(self, message):
        sender = message.sender_id
        content = message.content
        print(f"Received greeting from {sender}: {content}")
        
        # Send a response
        response = Message(
            sender_id=self.id,
            receiver_id=sender,
            content="Hello! Nice to meet you!",
            message_type="greeting_response"
        )
        self.send_message(response)
    
    @tool
    def calculate_sum(self, a, b):
        """Calculate the sum of two numbers."""
        return a + b

# Create and start the agent
agent = MyAgent("agent1")
agent.start()
```

## Agent Communication

Agents communicate by sending messages to each other. Here's how to send a message:

```python
from adk import Message

# Create a message
message = Message(
    sender_id="agent1",
    receiver_id="agent2",
    content="Hello, Agent 2!",
    message_type="greeting"
)

# Send the message
agent1.send_message(message)
```

To receive messages, agents register message handlers for specific message types:

```python
def handle_message(self, message):
    print(f"Received message: {message.content}")

agent.register_message_handler("greeting", handle_message)
```

## Memory Systems

ADK provides different types of memory systems:

```python
# Store information in short-term memory
agent.memory.store("short_term", "task_status", "in_progress")

# Retrieve information from memory
status = agent.memory.retrieve("short_term", "task_status")

# Store information in long-term memory
agent.memory.store("long_term", "user_preference", {"theme": "dark"})
```

## Planning and Goal Setting

ADK includes planning capabilities:

```python
from adk.planning import Goal, Plan, Task

# Create a goal
goal = Goal("Analyze customer feedback", "Identify key themes in customer feedback")

# Create tasks
task1 = Task("collect_data", "Collect customer feedback data")
task2 = Task("analyze_sentiment", "Analyze sentiment in feedback")
task3 = Task("identify_themes", "Identify common themes")

# Create a plan
plan = Plan(goal)
plan.add_task(task1)
plan.add_task(task2, dependencies=[task1])
plan.add_task(task3, dependencies=[task2])

# Execute the plan
agent.execute_plan(plan)
```

## Tool Usage

Tools are functions that agents can use to perform specific tasks:

```python
from adk import tool

@tool
def search_database(query):
    """Search the database for information."""
    # Implementation...
    return results

# Register the tool with an agent
agent.register_tool("search_database", search_database)

# Use the tool
results = agent.use_tool("search_database", "customer feedback")
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

ADK provides monitoring and debugging capabilities:

```python
from adk.monitoring import Monitor

# Create a monitor
monitor = Monitor()

# Register agents with the monitor
monitor.register_agent(agent1)
monitor.register_agent(agent2)

# Start monitoring
monitor.start()

# View agent activities
activities = monitor.get_agent_activities("agent1")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Modular Design**: Break down complex agent behaviors into smaller, reusable components.
2. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in your agents to prevent crashes.
3. **Memory Management**: Use appropriate memory systems for different types of information.
4. **Message Validation**: Validate incoming messages to ensure they have the expected format.
5. **Testing**: Write tests for your agents to ensure they behave as expected.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Agent not receiving messages**:
   - Check that the agent is properly registered with the message bus.
   - Verify that the sender is using the correct receiver ID.

2. **Memory retrieval failures**:
   - Ensure the key exists in the specified memory type.
   - Check for typos in memory keys.

3. **Tool execution errors**:
   - Verify that the tool is properly registered with the agent.
   - Check that the tool arguments are correct.
