IntelliFlow: Architecture Diagram
System Architecture Overview
The IntelliFlow multi-agent data analysis platform is built on a sophisticated
architecture that orchestrates specialized agents through the Agent Development Kit
(ADK) and integrates seamlessly with Google Cloud services. The architecture follows a
modular design that enables scalable, flexible, and robust data analysis workflows.
Below is a detailed description of the architecture diagram that would be created for the
final submission:

Core Components
The architecture consists of the following primary components:
1. Agent Orchestration Layer
2. Central Orchestrator Agent (ADK-based)
3. Agent Communication Bus (Google Pub/Sub)
4. Shared Context Store (Cloud Firestore)
5. Workflow Management System (Cloud Workflows)
6. Specialized Agent Cluster
7. Data Scout Agent
8. Data Engineer Agent
9. Analysis Strategist Agent
10. Insight Generator Agent
11. Visualization Specialist Agent
12. Narrative Composer Agent
13. Google Cloud Integration Layer
14. BigQuery Integration
15. Vertex AI Services
16. Cloud Storage
17. Document AI
18. Data Studio Connector

19. External Data Sources Layer
20. Structured Data Sources
21. API Connectors
22. Document Repositories
23. Streaming Data Inputs
24. Output & Visualization Layer
25. Interactive Dashboards
26. Report Generation System
27. Alert & Notification System
28. Insight Repository

Data Flow
The architecture diagram would illustrate the following data flow:
1. Data Scout Agent identifies and connects to data sources through the External Data
Sources Layer
2. Raw data flows through the Google Cloud Integration Layer into Cloud Storage
3. Data Engineer Agent processes and transforms the data using BigQuery and Cloud
Functions
4. Analysis Strategist Agent evaluates the prepared data and selects analytical
approaches
5. Insight Generator Agent applies selected techniques using Vertex AI and BigQuery
6. Results flow to both the Visualization Specialist and Narrative Composer Agents
7. Final insights, visualizations, and narratives are assembled by the Orchestrator
Agent
8. Completed analysis is delivered through the Output & Visualization Layer

Agent Communication Patterns
The diagram would highlight the following communication patterns:
1. Publish-Subscribe: Agents communicate asynchronously through Google Pub/Sub
topics
2. Request-Response: Direct inter-agent queries for specific information
3. Shared State: Agents access and update shared context in Cloud Firestore
4. Event-Driven: Agents respond to system events and data state changes

Deployment Architecture
The deployment architecture would show:
1. Containerized Agents: Each agent deployed as a containerized service in Cloud
Run
2. Serverless Functions: Specialized analytical capabilities implemented as Cloud
Functions
3. Managed Services: Leveraging Google Cloud managed services for data processing
and storage
4. API Gateway: Secure external access to the system through Cloud API Gateway

Security & Governance
The architecture includes:
1. Identity & Access Management: Fine-grained access control through IAM
2. Data Governance: Lineage tracking and metadata management
3. Encryption: Data encryption at rest and in transit
4. Audit Logging: Comprehensive activity logging and monitoring
This architecture diagram would be created as a professional visualization using
appropriate diagramming tools, with clear labels, color-coding for different components,
and directional arrows showing data and control flows between system elements.
