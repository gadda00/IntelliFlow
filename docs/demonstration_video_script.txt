IntelliFlow: Demonstration Video Script
Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)
[Opening shot: IntelliFlow logo animation fades in]
Welcome to IntelliFlow, a revolutionary multi-agent data analysis platform built with
Google Cloud's Agent Development Kit. Today, we'll demonstrate how IntelliFlow
orchestrates specialized AI agents to transform raw data into actionable business
intelligence through autonomous collaboration.
[Cut to presenter with architecture diagram in background]
IntelliFlow addresses a critical challenge in modern data analytics: the complexity and
time-intensive nature of comprehensive data analysis pipelines. By decomposing the
analysis workflow into specialized agent roles and orchestrating their interactions
through ADK, IntelliFlow enables faster, more thorough, and more insightful data
exploration than traditional approaches.

System Architecture Overview (0:30 - 1:00)
[Animated architecture diagram highlighting each component as mentioned]
IntelliFlow's architecture consists of seven specialized agents, each with distinct
capabilities:
• The Data Scout discovers and extracts data from various sources
• The Data Engineer transforms raw data into analysis-ready formats
• The Analysis Strategist determines optimal analytical approaches
• The Insight Generator applies these techniques to discover patterns and trends
• The Visualization Specialist creates compelling visual representations
• The Narrative Composer translates findings into accessible business narratives
• And the Orchestrator coordinates the entire ecosystem
All agents are built using ADK and leverage Google Cloud services including BigQuery,
Vertex AI, and Cloud Functions.

Live Demonstration (1:00 - 2:15)
[Screen recording of the platform in action]
Let's see IntelliFlow in action with a real-world scenario: analyzing customer feedback
data to identify improvement opportunities.
[Show Data Scout connecting to data sources]
First, the Data Scout agent connects to our customer feedback database in BigQuery,
identifies relevant tables, and extracts the raw data.
[Show Data Engineer processing the data]
Next, the Data Engineer agent cleans and transforms the data, handling missing values
and normalizing text fields for analysis.
[Show Analysis Strategist selecting approaches]
The Analysis Strategist agent evaluates the prepared data and determines that
sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and trend analysis would yield the most valuable
insights.
[Show Insight Generator applying techniques]
The Insight Generator agent applies these techniques using Vertex AI, discovering that
product reliability issues are driving negative sentiment in recent feedback.
[Split screen showing Visualization Specialist and Narrative Composer]
Simultaneously, the Visualization Specialist creates trend charts and sentiment
distribution visualizations, while the Narrative Composer generates a clear explanation
of the findings.
[Show final dashboard with insights]
Finally, the Orchestrator agent assembles everything into this comprehensive
dashboard, highlighting the key insight that addressing product reliability could
significantly improve customer satisfaction.

Technical Implementation (2:15 - 2:45)
[Code snippets and Google Cloud console]

IntelliFlow is built entirely on ADK's agent architecture. Each specialized agent is
implemented as a distinct ADK agent with custom tools and capabilities.
[Show agent communication flow]
Agent communication follows a structured protocol using ADK's native messaging
capabilities, enhanced by Google Pub/Sub for scalable message passing.
[Show Google Cloud integration points]
We've leveraged several Google Cloud services to enhance IntelliFlow's capabilities,
including BigQuery for data storage and analysis, Vertex AI for machine learning, and
Cloud Functions for serverless agent deployment.

Conclusion (2:45 - 3:00)
[Return to presenter]
IntelliFlow demonstrates the power of multi-agent collaboration using ADK and Google
Cloud. By orchestrating specialized agents through the entire data analysis lifecycle,
we've created a system that can autonomously transform raw data into actionable
insights with minimal human intervention.
