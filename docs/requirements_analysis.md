   - Optimize data structures for efficient analysis

3. **Analysis Strategy Selection**:
   - Dynamically select appropriate analytical approaches based on data characteristics
   - Support statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and visualization techniques
   - Adapt strategies based on business objectives

4. **Insight Generation**:
   - Implement pattern recognition, correlation analysis, anomaly detection, and trend identification
   - Generate quantitative findings and business insights
   - Support explainable AI approaches

5. **Visualization Creation**:
   - Generate clear, compelling visual representations of analytical findings
   - Select optimal chart types, color schemes, and layouts
   - Create interactive dashboards

6. **Narrative Generation**:
   - Translate technical results into accessible business narratives
   - Contextualize insights and suggest potential actions
   - Generate natural language explanations

7. **Workflow Orchestration**:
   - Manage workflow sequencing and inter-agent communication
   - Handle conflict resolution between agents
   - Ensure cohesive integration of each agent's contributions

### Technical Implementation Requirements

1. **Repository Structure**: Follow the specified repository organization:
   - Root directory with README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE, architecture.png
   - Subdirectories for docs, agents, orchestration, integrations, common, config, tests, examples, deployment

2. **Agent Implementation Structure**: Each agent should have its own directory with:
   - README.md: Agent-specific documentation
   - main.py: Entry point
   - tools/: Agent-specific tools
   - models/: Data models and schemas
   - services/: Business logic and services
   - config/: Agent-specific configuration
   - tests/: Agent-specific tests

3. **Orchestration Layer**: Implement components for:
   - Workflow definition and execution
   - Inter-agent communication system
   - Shared state management
   - Conflict resolution
   - System monitoring and logging

4. **Communication Patterns**: Implement the following patterns:
   - Publish-Subscribe: Asynchronous communication through Google Pub/Sub
   - Request-Response: Direct inter-agent queries
   - Shared State: Access and update shared context in Cloud Firestore
   - Event-Driven: Response to system events and data state changes

5. **Deployment Architecture**:
   - Containerized Agents: Each agent as a containerized service in Cloud Run
   - Serverless Functions: Specialized capabilities as Cloud Functions
   - Managed Services: Leverage Google Cloud managed services
   - API Gateway: Secure external access through Cloud API Gateway

6. **Security & Governance**:
   - Identity & Access Management: Fine-grained access control
   - Data Governance: Lineage tracking and metadata management
   - Encryption: Data encryption at rest and in transit
   - Audit Logging: Comprehensive activity logging and monitoring

## Design Principles

1. **Agent Specialization and Collaboration**:
   - Implement highly specialized agents rather than generalist agents
   - Design effective communication protocols between agents
   - Use structured message schemas and shared context stores

2. **ADK Implementation Principles**:
   - Use tool-based architecture for specialized agent capabilities
   - Optimize message passing through batching and priority queues
   - Implement appropriate state management across agent interactions
   - Ensure robust error handling at both agent and orchestration levels

3. **Multi-Agent System Design Principles**:
   - Define clear responsibility boundaries between agents
   - Support both sequential and parallel execution patterns
   - Enable adaptive strategy selection based on data characteristics
   - Prioritize explainability throughout the pipeline
   - Implement incremental result sharing between agents
